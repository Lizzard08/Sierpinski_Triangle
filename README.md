# Sierpinski_Triangle

This repository utilizes tools provided by WebGL to design the Sierpinski triangle. 

The following is a portion of the paper I wrote for a Graphics Programming class alongside this program. THE FOLLOWING IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY.

""Computer graphics involve the various aspects used to produce images or pictures using a computer (Angel, 2015). Producing images with computers requires a graphics system such as OpenGL. OpenGL provides the foundation for WebGL, which is the “graphics system approach supported by most web browsers” (Angel, 2015). Graphics systems all consist of input devices, output devices, a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), memory, and a framebuffer (Angel, 2015). These components may vary in appearance and type but are all essential to the graphics system. Essentially all modern graphics systems are “raster based”, meaning the images displayed on the output device is a raster or array of pixels that are stored in a part of memory called the framebuffer (Angel, 2015). The resolution or number of pixels within the framebuffer, as well as the depth or precision of the framebuffer determine the amount of detail that can be seen and the color representation of an image (Angel, 2015). Within the framebuffer, geometric objects are converted to pixel colors and locations in a process called rasterization or scan conversion (Angel, 2015). These special graphics functions are all carried out by the GPU, taking the task off the CPU (Angel, 2015). Output devices dominantly consisted of a cathode-ray tube (CRT) until recent developments (Angel, 2015). A CRT consists of a tube with phosphor coating that emits light when electrons hit the coating (Angel, 2015). Input devices are commonly a mouse, keyboard, joystick, or touchscreen, and are used to interact with the computer (Angel, 2015).
	Graphics programming allows us to create two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects with a computer. The application programming interface (API) allows for easier program development by providing various functions for us to work with. The WebGL API consists of various graphics functions including primitive functions, attribute functions, viewing functions, transformation functions, input functions, control functions, and query functions (Angel, 2015). These various functions allow us to work with the API without necessarily knowing about the internal workings, like a black box (Angel, 2015). We use Javascript to write the functionality for the program and use a web page written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to execute the program.
	After being able to create an image using the various tools provided by the WebGL API, we learned how to add animation to the object being displayed. This animation can occur on its own or with the use of user-interaction. This interaction can be done with the use of buttons or by using the mouse as input devices for the program. Events and event listeners are used within the program to determine when an event occurs and how to respond to that event (Angel, 2015). 
	Geometric objects consist of lines, polygons, and polyhedra, and can be described using concepts such as length and angle (Angel, 2015). The simplest geometric object is a point, while scalars are real and complex numbers that are objects “that obey a set of rules that are abstractions of the operations of ordinary arithmetic” (Angel, 2015). Vectors allow us to work with directions and magnitude, but do not have a fixed location (Angel, 2015). We can transform various objects using translation, rotation, and scaling (Angel, 2015). Translation moves an object to a different location, rotation turns the object, and scaling is used to make an object larger or smaller (Angel, 2015).
	Viewing with a computer is different from classical viewing. Classical viewing is determined by “a specific relationship between the objects and the viewer” and are traditionally used by architects and artists (Angel, 2015). Computer viewing is “based on the synthetic-camera model” and can construct classical views with the placement of the proper camera (Angel, 2015). WebGL provides various methods to manipulate perspectives of an object. Manipulating projections and shadows allows us to add more detail to an object.
	Lighting and shading are other ways we can manipulate a computer graphics object. Various surfaces and light sources can be used to change the perspective of the object. Some discrete techniques that can be used in object manipulation include texture mapping and bump mapping, which allow us to include more detail in an image (Angel, 2015).
	Finally, we learned about geometry processing and rasterization. Using the tools provided we were able to bring everything together to create a detailed object with a computer program. We learned about various algorithms for hidden-surface removal such as the Z-Buffer and the Painter’s Algorithm. The many tools provided by WebGL allow us to create, animate, and manipulate objects using a computer graphics system.""
